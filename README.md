# Gaussian-preserving maps in frequency-entangled biphoton spectroscopy

This repository contains scripts and data for simulating frequency-entangled biphoton spectroscopy using Gaussian-preserving correlation matrix dynamics.

## 🧠 Overview

We use a bilinear bosonic Hamiltonian to evolve the input joint spectral amplitude (JSA) through cavity and material interactions, and analyze the output JSI and entanglement entropy.
